## What is DeepBridge?

DeepBridge is a comprehensive Python framework that bridges the gap between model development and deployment. It provides a structured approach to validating machine learning models, optimizing their performance through distillation, and generating high-quality synthetic data for testing and augmentation.

## Key Features

DeepBridge is built around a powerful component-based architecture that enables modular and extensible machine learning workflows:

### Component-Based Architecture

The framework uses a delegation pattern to separate responsibilities into specialized components:

- **Experiment** - The central coordination point that delegates to specialized managers
- **BaseProcessor** - Abstract class defining core processing capabilities
- **Specialized Managers** - Handle specific aspects like models, hyperparameters, resilience, and uncertainty
- **TestRunner** - Coordinates test execution and result collection
- **VisualizationManager** - Centralizes visualization capabilities

### Validation Suites

DeepBridge provides comprehensive validation suites to ensure your models are production-ready:

- **Robustness Testing** - Evaluate model performance under data perturbations and adversarial conditions
- **Uncertainty Quantification** - Measure model uncertainty across different data distributions
- **Resilience Assessment** - Test model behavior with missing features and noisy inputs

### Knowledge Distillation

Optimize model deployment with advanced distillation techniques:

- **AutoDistiller** - Automated pipeline for teacher-student model distillation
- **Multiple Distillation Methods** - Knowledge distillation, surrogate models, and ensemble techniques
- **Optimization Techniques** - Pruning, quantization, and temperature scaling

### Synthetic Data Generation

Create high-quality synthetic data with built-in validation metrics:

- **Multiple Generation Methods** - Gaussian copula, CTGAN, and more
- **Quality Assessment** - Comprehensive metrics for similarity, utility, and privacy
- **Scalable Generation** - Efficient generation for large datasets

## Getting Started

DeepBridge is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Start by installing the package:

```bash
pip install deepbridge
```

Then follow our [Quick Start Guide](tutorials/quickstart.md) to begin your first experiment.

## Example Usage

```python
from deepbridge.core.experiment import Experiment
from deepbridge.core.db_data import DBDataset
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
dataset = DBDataset(data, target_column="target")

# Create an experiment
experiment = Experiment(dataset)

# Run comprehensive validation
results = experiment.validate(
    robustness=True,
    uncertainty=True,
    resilience=True
)

# Generate report
experiment.generate_report("experiment_results")
```
