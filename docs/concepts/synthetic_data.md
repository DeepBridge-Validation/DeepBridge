# Synthetic Data Generation

## Overview

Synthetic data generation creates artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties and relationships of original data without containing actual records. DeepBridge provides multiple methods for generating high-quality synthetic data to support model development, testing, and validation.

## Importance of Synthetic Data

Synthetic data offers several advantages in machine learning workflows:

1. **Privacy Protection**: Eliminates exposure of sensitive information while maintaining data utility
2. **Augmentation**: Increases the volume of training data to improve model performance
3. **Addressing Imbalance**: Helps balance underrepresented classes in the original dataset
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Creates rare but important scenarios for thorough testing
5. **Development Without Access**: Enables development when access to real data is restricted

## Generation Methods

DeepBridge implements several state-of-the-art methods for synthetic data generation:

### UltraLightGenerator

A lightweight, efficient generator that produces synthetic tabular data with minimal computational overhead.

**Key Features**:
- Fast performance on large datasets
- Support for mixed data types
- Preservation of feature distributions and correlations
- Low memory footprint

### Gaussian Copula

A statistical approach that uses copulas to model the dependencies between variables while preserving their marginal distributions.

**Key Features**:
- Accurate representation of feature distributions
- Preservation of multivariate relationships
- Flexibility with different correlation types
- Efficient for continuous data

### CTGAN

A GAN-based approach specifically designed for tabular data, using conditional generation to handle mixed continuous and discrete variables.

**Key Features**:
- Handles mixed data types effectively
- Captures complex relationships between features
- Mode-specific normalization for continuous columns
- Training stabilization through conditional generation

## Quality Assessment

The quality of synthetic data is evaluated along multiple dimensions:

### Statistical Similarity

Measures how well the synthetic data preserves the statistical properties of the original data:

- **Univariate Distributions**: Comparison of individual feature distributions
- **Correlation Structure**: Preservation of relationships between features
- **Multivariate Density**: Overall similarity in multivariate space

### Privacy Protection

Assesses the risk of re-identification or information leakage:

- **Re-identification Risk**: Probability of linking synthetic records to original individuals
- **Attribute Disclosure**: Risk of revealing sensitive attributes
- **Membership Inference**: Ability to determine if a record was in the training data

### Utility Preservation

Evaluates how well models trained on synthetic data perform compared to those trained on real data:

- **Model Performance**: Comparison of predictive performance
- **Feature Importance**: Preservation of feature significance
- **Decision Boundaries**: Similarity of model decision surfaces

## Example Implementation

```python
from deepbridge.synthetic import UltraLightGenerator, SyntheticDataEvaluator
import pandas as pd

# Load original dataset
original_data = pd.read_csv("original_data.csv")

# Initialize generator
generator = UltraLightGenerator()

# Fit to the original data
generator.fit(original_data)

# Generate synthetic data
synthetic_data = generator.generate(n_samples=len(original_data))

# Evaluate quality
evaluator = SyntheticDataEvaluator(original_data, synthetic_data)
quality_metrics = evaluator.evaluate()

print(f"Statistical similarity: {quality_metrics['statistical_similarity']:.2f}")
print(f"Privacy score: {quality_metrics['privacy_score']:.2f}")
print(f"Utility score: {quality_metrics['utility_score']:.2f}")

# Visualize results
evaluator.plot_distributions()
evaluator.plot_correlation_comparison()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data before synthetic generation to avoid propagating data quality issues
2. **Evaluation**: Always evaluate synthetic data quality before using it for downstream tasks
3. **Method Selection**: Choose the appropriate generation method based on data characteristics and requirements
4. **Incremental Generation**: Generate data incrementally and validate at each step
5. **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporate domain-specific constraints to improve realism

## Technical Considerations

### Categorical Data Handling

Different approaches handle categorical data:

- **One-hot Encoding**: Transforms categorical variables into binary vectors
- **Gaussian Mixtures**: Models categorical data as mixtures of Gaussian distributions
- **Specialized Transformations**: Custom transformations for ordered or hierarchical categories

### Temporal Data

Generating synthetic temporal data requires:

- **Preserving Trends**: Maintaining long-term patterns
- **Seasonal Components**: Preserving cyclical patterns
- **Correlations Over Time**: Maintaining temporal dependencies

### Missing Data

Strategies for handling missing values:

- **Pattern Preservation**: Maintaining the pattern of missingness
- **Imputation Before Generation**: Filling missing values before training generators
- **Direct Modeling**: Explicitly modeling missing values as part of the data generation process

## Advanced Techniques

### Differential Privacy

Adding privacy guarantees through differential privacy mechanisms:

```python
from deepbridge.synthetic.privacy import DifferentiallyPrivateGenerator

# Set privacy parameters (epsilon controls privacy-utility tradeoff)
dp_generator = DifferentiallyPrivateGenerator(epsilon=1.0)
private_synthetic_data = dp_generator.generate(original_data, n_samples=1000)
```

### Conditional Generation

Generating synthetic data with specific conditional constraints:

```python
from deepbridge.synthetic import ConditionalGenerator

# Generate data with specific constraints
conditions = {'age': '> 60', 'income': '< 50000'}
conditional_generator = ConditionalGenerator(base_generator='ctgan')
conditional_data = conditional_generator.generate_conditional(
    original_data,
    conditions=conditions,
    n_samples=500
)
```

## Common Challenges

1. **Overfitting**: When synthetic data becomes too similar to original data, increasing privacy risks
2. **Underfitting**: When synthetic data fails to capture important patterns in the original data
3. **Rare Cases**: Difficulty generating rare but significant patterns in the data
4. **Validation**: Challenges in comprehensively evaluating synthetic data quality
5. **Scalability**: Performance issues with large or complex datasets

## Future Directions

Research in synthetic data generation continues to evolve, with promising directions including:

- **Neural Network Architectures**: Specialized architectures for improved tabular data generation
- **Federated Learning**: Generating synthetic data from distributed sources without sharing original data
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining statistical and deep learning methods for improved quality
- **Domain-Specific Generation**: Specialized generators for domains like healthcare, finance, and more
